  <title>Privacy Policy for Europana automatic metrics</title>  
</head>

<body>
  <p>
The site http://jolanwuyts.eu links to a simple script for internal use at the Europeana Foundation, 
called Europeana automatic metrics. The script incorporates the freely reusable (under a GNU 3 GPL) 
code from the ImportJSON script originally created by Brad Jasper and Trevor Lohrbeer. 
You can find the project website for ImportJSON <a href="https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON">here</a>.
Europeana automatic metrics is hosted by Google as a Google Apps script. Europeana automatic metrics does not send any
private information about individual users to the developer, me. I will never collect any such information in the future.
The script is provided free of charge under a GNU General Public License, version 3. It contains no advertising, nor will 
it ever contain advertising. It is not monetised and will never be monetised in the future. 
</p>

<p>
Europeana automatic metrics collects information about the Europeana thematic collections through a JSON call to the 
Europeana RESTful Search API. This data is dumped into a Google Sheets tab. The only self-written code in this script is
the createSnapshot() function in copymonthly.gs. It copies the values of the live data tab over to a new tab, naming it with
the timestamp the snapshot was taken at. The snapshot is taken automatically every month through a Google Apps Scripts 
trigger, or can be taken manually with the 'take snapshot' button on the live sheets tab. 
</p>


<p>
The script doesn't collect any user information, it connects to the Europeana API as its only outside surface.The script
only sends user-entered query requests to the Europeana API, but no other information that wasn't entered by the user
manually. I am not responsible for the collection of data and logs that the Europeana API might collect. createSnapshot()
only copies the values from the live tab over to another tab within the same spreadsheet, and does not copy data over 
to any other source. 
</p>

<p>

While http://jolanwuyts.eu might use Google Analytics, the Europeana automatic metrics script does not collect any 
user information. The script is intended for internal business use only, not for commercial purposes.
